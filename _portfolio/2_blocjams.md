short-description: BlocJams for iOS is awesome!

**Summary:**  This project focused on creating the front end of a music player (not unlike spotify or pandora) and was my first serious attempt working with javascript (eventually refactored to jQuery) and front-end development with more in depth uses of CSS and HTML than I’d previously attempted. (MOVE) with the full suite of volume and track position controls, track selections, with a few additional pages for selection, and a wide range of on-click and mouse-over/hover functions.

**Explanation:** BlocJams basically acts as a main skeleton of an online music player. It has a landing page and a collection page, but the meat of the application is the media player.  The landing page is mostly just style, with some popup icons and images, as well header links to the collection page. The collection page provides a listing of available albums and relevant descriptions (artist, album name, number of tracks, etc.) though in this basic version only as a singular repeated is shown. The player itself required substantially more functionality. It featured the album’s collection of songs (numbered) and allowed the user to scroll anywhere over a songs and have the play & pause button-icons replace the song’s number appropriately depending on the condition (more detail on this in the next section). Additionally the page also featured a “player-bar” which beyond displaying current track information, and providing forward & backward skip buttons, also used a time-duration “bar” which displayed the songs current position in real time (both in terms of x:xx minute/second numerical time formatting and also as percentage of the bar’s fill) and allowed players to move to move the “thumb” dot to select any point in the song to play from. Lastly, the bar also provided volume controls which used a similar “bar & draggable-thumb” system as the time-duration system. (INCLUDE PICTURES)
